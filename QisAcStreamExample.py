AN-031 - Application note demonstrating control of AC power modules via QIS and saving the outputted QIS data to csv

Automating via QIS is a lower overhead that running QPS (Quarch Power Studio) in full but still
provides easy access to data for custom processing.  This example uses quarchpy functions to set up
an AC power module with QIS.

There are several examples that run in series, these can be commented out if you want to simplify the actions:

simpleStreamExample() - This example streams data to a python data structure

QIS is distributed as part of the Quarchpy python package and does not require separate install
